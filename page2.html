    <h3>2.1) Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p> I was happy with the tools I used as Visual Studio Code is very helpful in the sense that it will pop up choices for the next part of the code which helps speed up the process, 
        it also highlights words in different colours so that it is alot easier to read and understand. Trello helps you keep track of what you are doing so nothing is missed out and 
        keeps tasks nicely organised.
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3>2.2) Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p>The tools I used were Visual Studio Code and Trello were fit for purpose so were very appropriate, Visual Studio Code allowed for writing code in both CSS and HTML5 all within the 
        same software and was easy to understand what was written with various parts of the code highlighted in different colours which helped speed up the project. Trello was perfect for 
        planning out tasks making sure the project was organised.
    </p>  
    
    <br>
    <h3>2.3) Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h3>
    <br>
    <p>The strengths of the website are that it is easy to read and navigate which is good because it is a text heavy website, the weaknesses are that it could be more engaging 
        with some images or icons to balance out that it is a very text heavy website. Overall I am still happy with the final result because it is fit for the purpose its meant for 
        which is to provide information,  the elements I'm not happy with are minor and this could be further developed by learning JavaScript, using images and icons.                                                                  
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>2.4) Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I could make further improvements by researching the full capabilities of CSS online, the website I would use is https://www.w3schools.com. Learning JavaScript to further enhance the webpage with 
        different features ie a button that makes the page scroll to the top of the page rather than just jumping to the top in a flash. Javascript can also add special 
        visual effects to the webpages buttons and user interactions in general. Images and icons could be used to further enhance the 
        websites look, maybe even abit more color so its more eyecatching.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>2.5) Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
    <br>
    <p>My webpage is simplistic in design, contains all of the required content. The webpage is easy to read which is a requirement of any webpage page containing alot of text. 
        The ability to get around the website is also made simple with the navigation bar at the top so the user can see the options, also select where they want to navigate to next with ease.
        It is essential that websites are comfortable easy to read and navigate so they are extremely user friendly to everyone.
