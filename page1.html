    <h3>1.1) Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h3>
    <br>
    <p> The purpose of IT in modern businesses is entirely dependant on the needs of the business for example a busy 
        warehouse or supermarket chain that sells alot of products needs  to keep track of inventory so that when a 
        particular product is selling quickly they can use the information gathered by computer systems more efficiently 
        to purchase new stock as the system can do this automatically, another purpose would be to store a vast amount  
        of information securely, i.e this could be company secrets or even for recording customer interactions in a more 
        organised way which helps to keep down business costs to pin point strategy towards more effective communication 
        i.e logging and dealing with customer complaints, communication between employees is also a purpose as they can 
        contact each other quickly through e-mail and company intranet which delivers information much quicker than any 
        letter or fax, time is money and computer systems streamline key areas of business.[1]

    <h3>1.2) Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need 
        to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In order for a digital project to be successful, you need to have good time management skills, planning effectively 
       the best way to proceed by creating a schedule with tools like Trello to create a list of tasks with a target deadline 
       for each specific task, an essential skill when working in a team is to be able to identify strengths and weaknesses 
       of the people you work with a communicate effectively using webapps such as Slack when delegating tasks.Relevant 
       software to use is important, learning from previous experience on projects can help by not making a time costly mistake again.  
       Making sure you have the tools & resources to do research to complete your project i.e search engines and specialist websites 
       & books when searching for knowledge. [2] Reference:

    <br>
    <h3>1.3) Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? 
        Include a link to your Trello board. </h3>
    <br>
    <p>To plan my website project I will create a Trello board starting with a To Do list, in progress also a completed section to keep 
        a full track on the project from start to finish. I will also create a list of all the tools and resources utilised for the task, 
        including how they have been used.

    <h3>1.4) Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital 
        projects to fail? Why?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The main issues that can cause digital projects to fail can be a lack of communication within the team for example not keeping 
       everyone updated with the task you are currently doing using tools such as Trello, Slack or even basic e-mail. Occasionally digital 
       project failure can be a result of poor planning (i.e, not  using tools effictively like Trello, Draw.io to make flow charts) even 
       by not having a definitive plan on software you will use in the process. Other reasons may be a lack of commitment from team members, 
       reason may include not showing up on time although this may be due to personal reasons it can deeply impact completion of any project.[3]                                                                                                      
       Referencing a survey conducted:

    <h3>1.5) Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – 
        how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
    <br>
    <p> The way I would select software and IT systems is that I would consider what I would need to be able to do, the software 
        or IT system would have to be fit for purpose for example I would use Trello to create a plan of how to proceed and keep 
        track of progress, Wordpad as it is free and it can be used to write out all of the information my website is going to 
        contain and Visual Studio Code to write the code because it is the software that I am most familiar with, also it allows for
        multiple types of code projects with in the same software which is more convenient to work in HTML5 and CSS side by side.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.6) Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you 
        achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and 
        GitHub help with your codes version control? </h3>
    <br>
    <p>GitHub allows me to store the code online so it is accessible from anywhere I may be working. I can also keep track of the 
       most up to date code that I will be using for any given project. Trello has helped organise my tasks so I can keep track of 
       where I'm up to and what time I have for each individual job to reach my ultimate goal which is completion of the project
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.7) Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does 
        GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>GDPR impacts digital projects such as website creation as the regulations are stricter in regards to how personal details are 
       collected and used, for example sensitive information that can be use to identify someone, The rule applys to any persons personal or 
       sensitive data and how it is used can be a breach of GDPR regulations, explicit permission must be gained from the owner of the information. 
       You can't just use someones personal information for your website or collect online identifiers (i.e someones device MAC address, IP or User account I.D's)[5]
