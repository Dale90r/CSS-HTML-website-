    <h3>3.1) Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p>The benefits of the IT tools I were that in Trello I could quickly see which tasks needed to be done and this was kept very organised. A drawback was that I had to stop productivity to update the Trello board. 
        Visual Studio Code was very benificial to use as the code is easier to read with the different colours the program uses for key areas of code, the main drawback was that every time something was done in  CSS and HTML 
        it had to be done splitscreen which meant saving files individually and then refreshing the webpage manually to check everything was working correctly. Working in a team would have made the process easier as people 
        think very differently which brings ideas that an individual developer may not have realised could make a project better, more over other benifits of teamwork are
        i.e discussing layout ideas, theme, researching knowledge to implement on the page, also updating Trello would have been more efficient with tasks delegated.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>3.2) Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In hindsight I could have improved my efficiency and productivity if I had drawn a design for my project first, to help visualise what looked good and to check if the content would be easy to read i.e against 
        different images or colours. I spent alot of time thinking about design rather than developing, because I had no clear plan of what the layout for the page would be. The project would have
        been completed more efficiently if I designed some layout ideas first.
  
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>3.3) Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In the interest of improving my own productivity next time I would create a drawing of my page layout to make the design process much smoother and clear. Researching by looking at other websites would have been 
        more beneficial to get a good idea of the types of layouts used in successful published websites, or even working as a team to discuss ideas because everyone approaches projects with a different thought process. 
        Slack could have been used to discuss ideas whilst working on the projects and to get assistance with the code needed for particular features like for example: dropdowns, navigation bars as they may already have the knowledge from
        previous projects experience.
    
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>3.4) Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
    <br>
    <p>How I would test digital solutions for example a webpage design, I would check the functionality of each feature to make sure it is fit for purpose,  has maximum compatibilty by testing on different devices and browsers. 
       Features that work on Google Chrome may not work on Internet Explorer or Firefox so to reach the maximum amount of users this has to be checked to see if users of different
       devices or browsers can view the webpage correctly without errors, making sure that it is a comfortable viewing experience.
