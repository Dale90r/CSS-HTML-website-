    <h3>1.5) Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The main constraint involving copyrights affecting websites is that a website creator could be liable for copyright infringement 
        if they use an image that is not original or created by themselves. The creator should get written permission from the content 
        owner before using any copyright protected intellectual property or check that the terms allow for such use from the source, the copyright owner 
        can have their content removed if permission is not obtained (i.e images, videos or even written work from other webpages is somebody elses intellectual property under the Copyright laws (UK)
        this can differ depending on where the website originates, under US law or any other country they may handle breaches differently according to their laws.)[5]

    <h3>1.6) Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that 
        people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome 
        them ?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Disabilties that can impact the ability to use websites can include hard of hearing, being unable to move, blindness and persons with 
       a lower cognitive ability, These disabilties could be caused by genetics or an unfortunate accident i.e a broken arm or even old age. 
       Some of the ways we can over come these issues is by using text alternatives rather than images, speech recognition for voice input, 
       larger text or functionality for text to be sent to a braille device.[6]

    <h3>1.7) Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The best filetypes are files that use a lossless format compression to avoid or minimise any loss of details, for example images that are size limited. 
       SVG, lossless WebP or PNG are best for icons, for photographs the best choices are WebP or Jpeg. Jpeg images are more compatible with older browsers but 
       WebP can offer better compression which allows for faster loading times depending on internet connection speed.[7]

    <h3>1.1) Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The layout I chose was a basic header, navigation bar, content and a footer, a simplistic design with a background gradient so it wasn't plain. I avoided using 
        images from the internet as images are protected by copyright law, also the design I created was fit for purpose and didn't require any advanced features or layout.
        I would create my own images in future designs depending on time constraints to further enhance the users viewing experience.
